# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
Week 10 Challenge


Part 1: Analyse and Explore the Climate Data
# Start my importing reqiured libraries and SQL toolkit
# Create an engine, and reflect the database into a new model
# View all calsses from automap
# Save references to each table
# Create a session to the engine created above.
# Create a link between inspect and the engine to get column names
# Find recet date by using order_by in a desc order
# Query the database with the required information to be used in the plot for "Precipitation (mm) from 2016-08-23 to 2017-08-23"
# Use the .describe method to get statistical information for the data frame above. 
# Get most active station by querying the database with func.count, group_by, and order_by desc methods and filters.
# Use the most active station to get highest, lowest, and average tempratures
# Use the last 12 months of the most active station to plot a histogram for temperatures for the last 12 months. 


Part 2: Design Your Climate App
# Start by importing required libraries.
# embed code written in the first part to different routes using the "@app.route" function in python, and then define the function based on previous code.
# Use the jsonify function at the end of each function to return a dictionary list
# End code with the debugger code.
